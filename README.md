# lunch-and-learn-fork

A template Vue.js app with Bootstrap taken from Frank during my time working at TD Lab

## Instructions

``` bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

Now go to http://localhost:8080/

## Deployment

``` bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a bunch of production-ready files in the ./dist folder.
To deploy to GitHub pages, grab those files and put them into their own repo (preferably USERNAME.github.io as it automatically sets up the environment).
